// Your mission this week is to create a Structured Linked List, a fundamental data structure that epitomizes dynamic and efficient data handling. 
// This task is not just about coding a list; it’s about understanding the intricate dance of interconnected nodes. 
// Assignment Specification: 
// Implement a Structured Linked List that supports any arbitrary data type.
//  Your list should support the following operations: 
//  - Initialization: Construct a list from an array of elements with an optional custom comparator. 
//  - Insertion: Add items to the list, maintaining its structure. 
//  - Search: Implement both a generic and predicate-based search. 
//  - Max: Determine the maximum value. 
//  - Predecessor: Determine the predecessor of a given value. 
//  - Rank: Calculate the number of elements less than a given value. 
//  - Delete: Remove an item, ensuring the list remains cohesive. 
//  - Enumerate: Traverse the list, applying an action to each element. 
//  Pay close attention to the handling of edge cases and null values.
